# R&P Technology Radar

[R&P Technology Radar](https://sara-sabr.github.io/rp-tech-radar/)

This radar has been adapted from the open sourced [Zalando Tech Radar](http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/). 
It is based on the [pioneering work by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

This repository contains the code to generate the visualization:
[`radar.js`](/radar.js) (based on [d3.js v4](https://d3js.org)).
Feel free to use and adapt it for your own purposes.

As a working example, you can check out `/index.html` &mdash; the source 
of our [R&P Technology Radar](https://sara-sabr.github.io/rp-tech-radar/).

# Modifications

This radar has been modified to be populated by inputting new data points
into `/data.csv` rather than directly into the script within `/index.html`.
The radar SVG has been placed into a webpage using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) theme [Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/freelancer/).
